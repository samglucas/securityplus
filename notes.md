# Security+ Class Notes

### Comparison of Cryptographic Algorithms

| Algorithm Type | Algorithm Name | Real-World Example / Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Symmetric** | Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) | **Secure Wi-Fi (WPA2/WPA3):** AES is the gold standard for securing home and enterprise wireless networks. |
| **Symmetric** | Triple DES (3DES) | **Legacy Banking:** Historically used by the payments industry for EMV chip cards and ATM PIN encryption (now being phased out for AES). |
| **Symmetric** | Blowfish | **Password Managers:** Used by tools like KeePass to encrypt local database files due to its speed on smaller microprocessors. |
| **Symmetric** | Rivest Cipher (RC4) | **Legacy Web Browsing:** Formerly the most widely used stream cipher in SSL/TLS (now deprecated due to security vulnerabilities). |
| **Symmetric** | Salsa20 | **High-Speed Messaging:** Used in the XSalsa20 variant by the NaCl library and Libsodium for high-performance, secure communication. |
| **Asymmetric** | RSA | **Web Security (SSL/TLS):** Used for the initial handshake and identity verification when you visit an `https://` website. |
| **Asymmetric** | Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) | **Software Distribution:** Used to sign Linux kernel updates or software packages to ensure the code hasn't been tampered with. |
| **Asymmetric** | Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) | **Cryptocurrencies:** Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECC (specifically Secp256k1) to generate public/private keys and sign transactions. |
| **Asymmetric** | Diffie-Hellman (DH) | **Secure Key Exchange:** Allows two parties (like your phone and a server) to create a shared secret key over an insecure channel without ever sending the key itself. |

### Hashing Algorithms Comparison

| Algorithm | Real-World Example / Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Message Digest 5 (MD5)** | **File Integrity Checks:** Commonly used by software distributors to provide a "checksum" so users can verify a downloaded `.iso` or `.exe` file isn't corrupted. *(Note: Not secure against intentional tampering).* |
| **Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)** | **Git Version Control:** Git uses SHA-1 hashes to identify and track changes to files and commits in a repository. |
| **SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512)** | **Blockchain & Mining:** SHA-256 is the engine behind Bitcoin mining and is the standard for securing modern SSL/TLS certificates. |
| **SHA-3** | **Next-Gen Security:** Often used as a high-security alternative to SHA-2 in hardware implementations and sensitive government applications because its internal "Sponge" design is resistant to different types of attacks. |
| **RIPEMD (e.g., RIPEMD-160)** | **Bitcoin Addresses:** Used in combination with SHA-256 to create shorter, manageable public wallet addresses for cryptocurrencies. |
