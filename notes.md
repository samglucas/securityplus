### Comparison of Cryptographic Algorithms

| Algorithm Type | Algorithm Name | Real-World Example / Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Symmetric** | Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) | **Secure Wi-Fi (WPA2/WPA3):** AES is the gold standard for securing home and enterprise wireless networks. |
| **Symmetric** | Triple DES (3DES) | **Legacy Banking:** Historically used by the payments industry for EMV chip cards and ATM PIN encryption (now being phased out for AES). |
| **Symmetric** | Blowfish | **Password Managers:** Used by tools like KeePass to encrypt local database files due to its speed on smaller microprocessors. |
| **Symmetric** | Rivest Cipher (RC4) | **Legacy Web Browsing:** Formerly the most widely used stream cipher in SSL/TLS (now deprecated due to security vulnerabilities). |
| **Symmetric** | Salsa20 | **High-Speed Messaging:** Used in the XSalsa20 variant by the NaCl library and Libsodium for high-performance, secure communication. |
| **Asymmetric** | RSA | **Web Security (SSL/TLS):** Used for the initial handshake and identity verification when you visit an `https://` website. |
| **Asymmetric** | Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) | **Software Distribution:** Used to sign Linux kernel updates or software packages to ensure the code hasn't been tampered with. |
| **Asymmetric** | Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) | **Cryptocurrencies:** Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECC (specifically Secp256k1) to generate public/private keys and sign transactions. |
| **Asymmetric** | Diffie-Hellman (DH) | **Secure Key Exchange:** Allows two parties (like your phone and a server) to create a shared secret key over an insecure channel without ever sending the key itself. |
